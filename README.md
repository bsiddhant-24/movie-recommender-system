Problem statement
Existing movie recommendation systems often struggle to cater to individual preferences, especially for new users or those with unique tastes. Collaborative filtering falls short in addressing these challenges. To enhance user satisfaction, we need an advanced content-based movie recommendation system that analyzes diverse content attributes like genres, actors, directors, and themes. This system aims to provide accurate and personalized suggestions, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for all users.
